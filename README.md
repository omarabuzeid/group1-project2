### Thomas & Omar's Project: The Musk Effect

## Challenge:
With the rise of social media, we have seen the simultaneous rise of prominent market influencers. The notion of a market influencer isn’t new. Prior generations were enraptured by star investors like Bill Miller, Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett. Today’s influencers however, aren’t defined by track record or expertise per say. The rapper Snoop Dogg, for example, was credited with sending the price of cryptocurrency dogecoin soaring after he tweeted an altered version of one of his album covers, showing himself with a “doge" head.

No market influencer is perhaps more infamous than Tesla CEO Elon Musk.  One January afternoon, Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk sent out an 11-character tweet: “Gamestonk!!". The market reaction was perhaps unprecedented. Musk's followers sprung into action, and GameStop Corp. shares surged more than 150% overnight. The next day, analysts threw up their hands. Nothing apart from Mr. Musk’s tweet—which included a link to Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum—could explain why the stock soared.

Tesla meanwhile, Musk's very own company, has seen tremendous growth over the past 5 years.  With that said it is still a pretty volatile stock. Therefore, we decided to find out the effect Elon Musk's tweets on the price of Tesla's stock, and if so, whether or not a net positive trading strategy could be created to capitalize on said effects. 


## Model:
After preparing the necessary data to analyse sentiment within Mr. Musk's tweets, as well as retreiving the relevant stock market data, we began to work on our model.
